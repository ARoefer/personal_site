<h4 class="text-muted">Controlling robot end effectors from your smartphone.</h4>

<p>Re-positioning your robot's end effector after an experiment can be quite tedious. In the case of more industrial-style robots like the <a href="https://www.universal-robots.com/">URs</a> you might have a teach-pendant that lets you control the end effector directly. With research oriented robots, like the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/PR2" target="_blank">PR2</a>, or the <a href="https://fetchrobotics.com/robotics-platforms/" target="_blank">Fetch</a> you will usually not have such a pendant. While both those robots offer control via a gamepad, I thought it might also be interesting to control these robots from your phone.</p>

<p>The <em>Smart EEF Control</em> ROS package provides such remote control functionality using <a href="https://github.com/SemRoCo/giskardpy" target="_blank">giskardpy</a>, and the <a href="http://robotwebtools.org/" target="_blank">Robot Web Tools</a>. The package starts a velocity controller and provides a web interface that can be displayed on a smartphone. The web interface uses an on-screen joystick to control the end effector's linear motion and uses the phone's orientation to control rotation.

<p>While this is certainly not the best way yet to control a robot, it is interesting to see how easily already present technology can be utilized to create a new mode of robotic interaction. The video below shows the controller in action, though only on a simulated robot.</p>
