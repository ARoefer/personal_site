      where: Amazon Development Center Berlin GmbH
      desc: Internship at Amazon Development Center in Berlin. Researched improvements to industrial robotic manipulation tasks. Developed low-level robot controller for optimal task performance. Implemented a new method of motion generation for the application in collaboration with an academic consultant. To enable a data-driven development process, created multiple tools for recording and processing performance data, and for predicting future system performance from historic data.

    - as: Research Collaborator
      from: August 2018
      until: September 2018
      where: University of Michigan
      desc: Second author on a research paper to be submitted to IROS 2019. The paper contributes to the field of indirect object search in large scale environments. Symbolic object relations are combined with metric observations to derive hypothetical object locations, guiding the search. The search itself uses a tightly integrated perception-control loop, allowing for dynamic camera control and occlusion avoidance.

    - as: Research Assistant
      from: April 2018
      until: July 2018
      where: University of Bremen
      desc: Research assistant at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence headed by Prof. Michael Beetz, tasked with evaluating the PyBullet physics engine's simulation capabilities regarding soft bodies and force-torque sensors. Developed an object oriented, easy-to-use wrapper for the engine and built a lightweight simulator on it for fast prototyping of motion controllers.

    - as: Research Intern
      from: October 2017
      until: February 2018
      where: University of Michigan
      desc: Research internship at the Laboratory for Progress headed by Prof. Chadwicke Jenkins. Helped with the first implementation of the giskardpy motion control library. Implemented a lightweight velocity control interface and giskardpy interface for the Fetch robot. Worked on a project investigating the automatic generation of task-space motion controllers based on background knowledge. The project aimed at integrating predicates for state assessments and motion controllers tightly, allowing for a direct generation of motion controllers from predicates. The resulting system was used in the joint research project mentioned above.
